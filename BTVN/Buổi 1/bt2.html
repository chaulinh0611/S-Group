    <h1>This is <i>still</i> a motherfucking website.</h1>
    <p>And it's more fucking perfect than the last guy's.</p>
    <h2>Seriously, it takes minimal fucking effort to improve this <br>
        shit.</h2>
    <h4>7 fucking declarations.</h4>
    <p>That's how much CSS it took to turn that
    <a href =  "https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/"><u>grotesque pile of shit</u></a>
    into this easy-to-read<br>
    masterpiece. It's so fucking simple and it still has all the glory of the original perfect-ass<br>
    website:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Shit's <i>still</i> lightweight and loads fast <br>
        </li>
        <li>
            <i>Still</i> fits on all your shitty screens <br>
        </li>
        <li>
            <i>Still</i> looks the same in all your shitty browsers<br>
        </li>
        <li>
            The motherfucker's <i>still </i>accessible to every asshole that visits your site<br>
        </li>
        <li>
            Shit's <i>still</i> legible and gets your fucking point across
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>And guess what, motherfucker:</h3> 
    <p>You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site. Here's how.</p>
    <h2>Let it breathe</h2>

    <p>Look at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building. Assuming they're not <br>
        married they probably shouldn't be humping. The defaults are trash -- pick a minimum <br>
        <big>line-height: 1.4</big> for body copy. Headings should be tighter. If you can't see<br>
        that...piss off.<br>
        <br>If your text hits the side of the browser, fuck off forever. You ever see a book like that?<br>
        Yes? What a shitty book.</p>
    <h2>A little less contrast</h2>
    <p>Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life? Tone it down a<br>
        bit, asshole. I would've even made this site's background a nice #EEEEEE if I wasn't so<br>
        focused on keeping declarations to a lean 7 fucking lines.</p>
    <h2>Size Matters</h2>
    <p>I know your partner says otherwise, but it's true. Bump that body copy to render close to<br>
        16px or more. Smaller type works well for print, not the screen.</p>
    <h2>Line-width, motherfucker</h2>
    <p>Looking at an LCD screen is strainful enough. Don't make me read a line of text that's<br>
        200 fucking characters long. Keep it to a nice 60-80 and users might actually read more<br>
        than one sentence of your worthless dribble.</p>
    <h3>Yes, this is <i>also</i> fucking satire, you fuck</h3>
    <p>
        I love what the creator of 
        <a href = "https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/" <u>this site's inspiration</u></a>What I'm saying is that it's so, so<br>
        simple to make sites easier to read. Websites are broken by default, they are functional,<br>
        high-performing, and accessible, but they're also fucking ugly. You and all the other web<br>
        designers out there need to make them not total shit.
